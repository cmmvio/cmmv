## üìù Commands to Execute

### Step 1: Add Documentation
```bash
cd /mnt/f/Node/cmmv/cmmv

# Add all documentation
git add docs/
git add openspec/
git add README.md
git add AGENTS.md
```

### Step 2: Optionally Add Configuration
```bash
# Only if you want to commit these
git add .cursor/
git add .cursorrules
git add .github/
```

### Step 3: Create Commit
```bash
git commit -m "docs: complete CMMV analysis with 7 OpenSpec proposals and test coverage analysis

**Analysis Highlights:**
- Complete project documentation (tech stack, conventions, constraints)
- Test coverage analysis: 53% current ‚Üí 95% target
- 7 improvement proposals with 637 implementation tasks
- 20-22 weeks total estimated effort

**OpenSpec Proposals (by priority):**
0. Test Coverage 95%+ (12 weeks, 267 tasks) - CRITICAL FIRST
   - @cmmv/vault has ZERO tests (encryption - HIGH RISK)
   - @cmmv/throttler has ZERO tests (rate limiting - HIGH RISK)
   - 7 packages completely untested
   
1. OAuth Provider Integration (10 days, 70 tasks) - HIGH
   - Google, Facebook, GitHub, Microsoft
   - Account linking and profile sync
   
2. API Versioning Support (9 days, 54 tasks) - HIGH
   - URI, header, media type strategies
   - Multi-version OpenAPI docs
   
3. Health Checks & Observability (14 days, 98 tasks) - CRITICAL
   - Kubernetes probes, Prometheus metrics
   - OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
   
4. Enhanced Throttler (7 days, 94 tasks) - HIGH
   - @RateLimit decorator, distributed limiting
   - Redis-backed, multiple strategies
   
5. Centralized Error Handling (7 days, 102 tasks) - HIGH
   - Exception filters, RFC 7807 format
   - Structured error logging
   
6. Application Scopes (12 days, 122 tasks) - CRITICAL
   - Multi-agent architecture support
   - Scoped DI, isolated instances

**Documentation Organization:**
- Cleaned up root directory per AGENTS.md rules
- Moved all non-root .md files to /docs
- Created comprehensive documentation structure

**Critical Finding:**
- SECURITY RISK: @cmmv/vault (encryption) has no tests
- SECURITY RISK: @cmmv/throttler (rate limiting) has no tests
- Strong recommendation: Implement test coverage FIRST

**All proposals are backward compatible**
**Total tasks: 637**
**Estimated effort: 20-22 weeks**"
```

### Step 4: Push (Manual - SSH Password Required)
```bash
# YOU NEED TO EXECUTE THIS MANUALLY
# It will prompt for your SSH certificate password

git push origin main
```

## üéØ After Push

### Next Steps:

1. **Review test coverage proposal:**
   ```bash
   cat openspec/changes/improve-test-coverage/proposal.md
   ```

2. **Read priority guide:**
   ```bash
   cat docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITY.md
   ```

3. **Make strategic decision:**

# Observability and Metrics Spec

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Prometheus Metrics Endpoint
The system SHALL expose a /metrics endpoint in Prometheus exposition format.

#### Scenario: Scrape metrics endpoint
- **WHEN** Prometheus scrapes GET /metrics
- **THEN** the system returns metrics in text format
- **AND** includes HELP and TYPE metadata
- **AND** includes all registered metrics
- **AND** response completes within 500ms

#### Scenario: Metrics include labels
- **WHEN** metrics are exported
- **THEN** each metric includes environment label (dev/staging/production)
- **AND** includes service name and version labels
- **AND** HTTP metrics include method, path, and status code labels

### Requirement: HTTP Request Metrics
The system SHALL collect HTTP request performance metrics.

#### Scenario: Track request duration
- **WHEN** an HTTP request is processed
- **THEN** the system records request duration in histogram
- **AND** buckets include [0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10]
- **AND** metric includes method and path labels

#### Scenario: Track request rate
- **WHEN** HTTP requests are received
- **THEN** the system increments request counter
- **AND** includes labels for method, path, and status code
- **AND** allows calculation of requests per second

#### Scenario: Track error rate
- **WHEN** HTTP request results in error (4xx or 5xx)
- **THEN** the system increments error counter
- **AND** includes status code and error type labels
- **AND** enables alerting on high error rates

### Requirement: Resource Metrics
The system SHALL collect system resource usage metrics.

#### Scenario: Monitor memory usage
- **WHEN** metrics are collected
- **THEN** the system reports heap used, heap total, and RSS
- **AND** includes external memory usage
- **AND** reports garbage collection statistics

#### Scenario: Monitor CPU usage
- **WHEN** CPU metrics are collected
- **THEN** the system reports CPU usage percentage
- **AND** includes user and system time
- **AND** updates every collection interval

#### Scenario: Monitor event loop lag
- **WHEN** event loop lag is measured
- **THEN** the system reports delay in milliseconds
- **AND** triggers warning if lag exceeds 100ms
- **AND** exports as gauge metric

### Requirement: Distributed Tracing
The system SHALL support distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry.

#### Scenario: Automatic HTTP request tracing
- **WHEN** HTTP request is received
- **THEN** the system creates a span for the request
- **AND** includes HTTP method, URL, and status code
- **AND** propagates trace context to downstream services
- **AND** records span duration

#### Scenario: Custom span creation
- **WHEN** developer uses @Trace decorator on method
- **THEN** the system creates a child span for that method
- **AND** includes method name and class name
- **AND** captures exceptions as span events
- **AND** links to parent span

#### Scenario: Trace context propagation
- **WHEN** application makes external HTTP request
- **THEN** the system injects trace context headers
- **AND** maintains trace ID across service boundaries
- **AND** enables end-to-end request tracing

### Requirement: Structured Logging
The system SHALL support structured logging with JSON format.

#### Scenario: Log in JSON format
- **WHEN** structured logging is enabled
- **THEN** logs are output as JSON objects
- **AND** includes timestamp, level, message, and context
- **AND** includes trace ID and span ID if available
- **AND** includes custom metadata fields

#### Scenario: Correlation ID in logs
- **WHEN** request is processed
- **THEN** all logs include the same correlation ID
- **AND** correlation ID is generated if not provided
- **AND** correlation ID propagates to async operations

### Requirement: Custom Metrics
The system SHALL support custom application metrics.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class OrderService {
    @Counter('orders_created_total', 'Total orders created')
    private ordersCreated: Counter;
    
    @Histogram('order_processing_duration', 'Order processing duration')
    private processingDuration: Histogram;
}
```

#### Scenario: Increment counter metric
- **WHEN** developer calls counter.inc()
- **THEN** the system increments the counter
- **AND** includes configured labels
- **AND** exports via /metrics endpoint

#### Scenario: Record histogram value
- **WHEN** developer records histogram value
- **THEN** the system updates histogram buckets
- **AND** calculates sum and count
- **AND** enables percentile calculations

### Requirement: Metrics Cardinality Protection
The system SHALL prevent unbounded metric cardinality.

#### Scenario: High-cardinality label values
- **WHEN** a metric label has many unique values
- **THEN** the system limits cardinality to configured maximum
- **AND** logs warning when limit is reached
- **AND** prevents memory exhaustion

### Requirement: APM Integration
The system SHALL support APM tool integration.

#### Scenario: New Relic integration
- **WHEN** New Relic is configured
- **THEN** the system sends telemetry to New Relic
- **AND** includes transactions, errors, and custom events
- **AND** supports distributed tracing

#### Scenario: DataDog integration
- **WHEN** DataDog is configured
- **THEN** the system sends metrics via DogStatsD
- **AND** sends traces to DataDog APM
- **AND** includes custom tags and metrics

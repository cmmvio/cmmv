# Comprehensive Test Coverage Improvement

## Why

Current test coverage analysis reveals **critical gaps** in CMMV's test suite:

**Current State:**
- Only **53% of packages** have tests (8 out of 15)
- **7 packages** have ZERO test coverage
- **Security modules** (@cmmv/vault, @cmmv/throttler) are untested
- **HTTP module** has minimal coverage (only controllers)
- **No coverage configuration** in vitest.config.ts

**Critical Risks:**
- Security vulnerabilities in untested encryption module (@cmmv/vault)
- Production failures in untested rate limiting (@cmmv/throttler)
- HTTP adapter bugs affecting all requests
- WebSocket/RPC issues in multi-agent scenarios
- No safety net for refactoring or breaking changes

**Benefits:**
- Catch bugs before production
- Safe refactoring and code evolution
- Confidence in breaking change detection
- Better code quality through TDD
- Faster onboarding (tests as documentation)
- CI/CD reliability

## What Changes

### Coverage Expansion
- **ADDED:** Comprehensive test suites for 7 untested packages
- **ADDED:** Coverage configuration in vitest.config.ts
- **ADDED:** CI/CD integration with coverage reporting
- **ADDED:** Pre-commit coverage checks
- **MODIFIED:** Existing test suites to improve coverage
- **ADDED:** Integration test suites
- **ADDED:** E2E test scenarios
- **ADDED:** Performance benchmarks
- **ADDED:** Security-focused test scenarios

### Testing Infrastructure
- **ADDED:** Code coverage thresholds (80% line, 70% branch)
- **ADDED:** Coverage badges in README
- **ADDED:** Automated coverage reports
- **ADDED:** Test scripts for different scenarios
- **ADDED:** Mock utilities expansion
- **ADDED:** Test fixtures and factories

## Impact

- **Affected specs:** testing, all untested packages
- **Affected code:**
  - `vitest.config.ts` - Add coverage configuration
  - `package.json` - New test scripts
  - All untested packages - New test suites:
    - `packages/vault/tests/` - NEW
    - `packages/throttler/tests/` - NEW
    - `packages/email/tests/` - NEW
    - `packages/keyv/tests/` - NEW
    - `packages/openapi/tests/` - NEW
    - `packages/ws/tests/` - NEW (exists but empty)
    - `packages/graphql/tests/` - NEW (exists but empty)
  - Existing test suites - Expansion and improvement
  - `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD integration
  - `.husky/pre-commit` - Coverage checks

- **Breaking Changes:** None
- **Development Impact:** Required test coverage slows initial development but prevents bugs
- **CI/CD Impact:** Build time increases (~2-3 minutes for full test suite)
- **Quality Impact:** Significant improvement in code quality and reliability

**Coverage Goals:**
- **Short term (3 months):** 95% overall coverage
  - Critical packages (vault, auth, throttler): 95%+
  - Important packages (http, ws, core): 85%+
  - Supporting packages: 75%+
  
- **Long term (6 months):** 95%+ sustained
  - All packages: minimum 75%
  - Zero coverage regression
  - Automated enforcement via CI/CD

**Estimated Effort:** 12 weeks (3 months)
- Weeks 1: Infrastructure setup
- Weeks 2-4: Critical packages (vault, throttler, auth)
- Weeks 5-6: API layer (http, ws)
- Weeks 7-8: Supporting modules
- Weeks 9-11: Integration, E2E, security tests
- Week 12: Documentation and cleanup

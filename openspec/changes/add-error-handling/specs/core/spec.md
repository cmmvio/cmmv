# Core Error Handling Spec

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Exception Filter Interface
The system SHALL define exception filter interface for implementing custom filters.

```typescript
export interface ExceptionFilter<T = any> {
    catch(exception: T, host: ArgumentsHost): any;
}
```

#### Scenario: Implement custom exception filter
- **WHEN** developer creates class implementing ExceptionFilter
- **THEN** it must implement catch() method
- **AND** receives exception and ArgumentsHost
- **AND** can return custom response

### Requirement: Arguments Host
The system SHALL provide ArgumentsHost for context abstraction.

```typescript
export interface ArgumentsHost {
    getArgs<T extends Array<any> = any[]>(): T;
    getArgByIndex<T = any>(index: number): T;
    switchToHttp(): HttpArgumentsHost;
    switchToRpc(): RpcArgumentsHost;
}
```

#### Scenario: Access HTTP context in filter
- **WHEN** filter calls host.switchToHttp()
- **THEN** receives HttpArgumentsHost
- **AND** can access request and response objects
- **AND** can modify response

### Requirement: Filter Registry
The system SHALL maintain registry of exception filters.

#### Scenario: Register global filter
- **WHEN** filter is registered in Application.create()
- **THEN** it's added to global filter registry
- **AND** applies to all controllers and routes

#### Scenario: Register controller-scoped filter
- **WHEN** filter is specified in @Controller decorator
- **THEN** it only applies to that controller's routes
- **AND** has higher priority than global filters

#### Scenario: Register route-scoped filter
- **WHEN** filter is specified in route decorator
- **THEN** it only applies to that specific route
- **AND** has highest priority

### Requirement: Filter Execution Order
The system SHALL execute filters in specific order.

#### Scenario: Multiple filters match exception
- **WHEN** exception matches multiple filters
- **THEN** route-scoped filter executes first
- **AND** then controller-scoped filter
- **AND** then global filter
- **AND** first filter to handle stops propagation

### Requirement: Error Recovery Strategies
The system SHALL support error recovery mechanisms.

#### Scenario: Retry transient errors
- **WHEN** database operation fails with transient error
- **THEN** system retries up to configured maximum
- **AND** uses exponential backoff
- **AND** logs retry attempts

#### Scenario: Circuit breaker activation
- **WHEN** external service has high error rate
- **THEN** circuit breaker opens
- **AND** subsequent calls fail fast
- **AND** periodically attempts to recover

### Requirement: Error Monitoring Integration
The system SHALL integrate with error monitoring services.

#### Scenario: Send error to Sentry
- **WHEN** unhandled exception occurs in production
- **THEN** system sends error to Sentry
- **AND** includes user context and tags
- **AND** attaches breadcrumbs for debugging

#### Scenario: Error webhook notification
- **WHEN** critical error occurs
- **THEN** system sends webhook to configured URL
- **AND** includes error details and severity
- **AND** allows custom webhook payloads

### Requirement: Error Correlation
The system SHALL correlate errors across distributed systems.

#### Scenario: Propagate correlation ID
- **WHEN** error occurs in a request
- **THEN** correlation ID is included in error logs
- **AND** correlation ID is returned to client
- **AND** allows tracing error across services

### Requirement: Graceful Degradation
The system SHALL support fallback responses for errors.

#### Scenario: Service unavailable fallback
- **WHEN** critical dependency is unavailable
- **THEN** system returns cached or default response
- **AND** logs degraded mode activation
- **AND** includes X-Degraded-Mode header

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Logger Service
The logger service SHALL support error context and structured logging.

#### Scenario: Log error with metadata
- **WHEN** logger.error() is called with error object
- **THEN** it extracts stack trace
- **AND** includes error name and message
- **AND** adds context metadata
- **AND** formats as JSON if configured

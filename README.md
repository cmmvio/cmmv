## Description

CMMV (Contract-Model-Model-View) is a revolutionary approach to web application development, redefining how we create, maintain, and scale modern projects. By leveraging contract-based development, CMMV automates the generation of APIs, controllers, ORM entities, and RPC communication, delivering an optimized and robust experience.

With a **high-performance HTTP server (@cmmv/server)** that replaces Express, CMMV ensures **4x better performance** while maintaining a familiar syntax inspired by NestJS. It now supports **RESTful API, RPC, and GraphQL(Future) outputs**, with seamless **SSR directive integration**.

CMMV also **merges @cmmv/view into @cmmv/http**, eliminating extra installations while retaining flexibility for **EJS, Mustache, and other view engines**. Additionally, new modules like **@cmmv/vault** (AES-256-GCM & ECC encryption) and **@cmmv/openapi** (automatic documentation generation) have been introduced, replacing the deprecated **@cmmv/swagger** module.

## Philosophy

CMMV simplifies development by leveraging TypeScript decorators and a modular architecture. It **removes complexity** by automating the core functionalities while allowing full **customization** for advanced use cases.

## Features

- **Contract-Driven Development:** Define models, controllers, and APIs with TypeScript contracts.
- **High-Performance HTTP Server:** Replaces Express with an optimized native server.
- **Modular Architecture:** Separate core and optional modules for scalability.
- **Multi-Protocol Support:** REST, RPC, and GraphQL with automatic type inference.
- **Integrated SSR:** Simple syntax for Server-Side Rendering.
- **Advanced Security:** Vault module for encrypted data storage (AES-256-GCM & ECC).
- **Automatic Documentation:** OpenAPI-based documentation from contracts.

## Setup with CLI

CMMV now provides a CLI (Command Line Interface) to streamline the installation process and quickly set up your project with the desired configurations.

To initialize a new project, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ pnpm dlx @cmmv/cli@latest create project-name
```

This command will walk you through a guided setup process, asking about your preferred configurations, such as enabling Vite, RPC, caching, repository type, and view setup (e.g., Vue 3 or Reactivity). It will automatically create the necessary files and folders, set up dependencies, and configure the project.

## Legacy Setup (Manual)

If you prefer to set up the project manually, you can still install the necessary modules individually:

```bash
$ pnpm add @cmmv/core @cmmv/http reflect-metadata fast-json-stringify
```

## Quick Start

Below is a simple example of how to create a new CMMV application:

```typescript
import { Application } from "@cmmv/core";
import { DefaultAdapter, DefaultHTTPModule } from "@cmmv/http";
import { ApplicationModule } from "./app.module";

Application.create({
    httpAdapter: DefaultAdapter,    
    modules: [
        DefaultHTTPModule,                      
        ApplicationModule
    ],
    providers: [...],
    contracts: [...]
});
```
